/**
 * Contains the result of KeyMapper.mapKeysV3. This data object can compute the mapping of hosts to keys
 * for a particular "iteration"
 *
 * Example use case:
 *
 * We have 2 keys 1 and 2.
 * Let's say for key 1, there are host 1,2,3.
 * and for key 2 there is only host 4.
 * Let's say the user wants 2 hosts per key.
 *
 * Then this object will contain the following mapping
 * {
 *   list:
 *   - [key 1], [host1, host2]
 *   - [key 2], [host4]
 * }
 *
 * when the user calls getFirstResult(), this indicates the user wants to know the mapping of the first "iteration".
 * So we return:
 * {
 *   - [key1], [host1]
 *   - [key2], [host4]
 * }
 *
 * when the user calls getResult(1), this indicates the user wants to know the mapping of the second "iteration".
 * So we return the following
 * {
 *   - [key1] , [host2]
 *   - [key2] is unmapped
 * }
 *
 * ------------------------
 *
 * It's possible that the same host appears twice depending on how the cluster is being partitioned.
 * For example
 *
 * We have keys 1,2,3.
 * keys 1 is served by host 1,2
 * keys 2 is served by host 2,3
 * keys 3 is served by host 1,3
 * we want to get 2 hosts per key because we want to try a backup retry
 *
 * We provide a method in HostToKeyMapper to "combine" the result depending on which "iteration" are you on
 *
 * So for the first try we will return
 * {
 *   list:
 *   - [key1, key3], [host 1]
 *   - [key2]. [host2]
 * }
 *
 * for the 2nd try we will return
 *
 * {
 *   list:
 *   - [key1], [host2]
 *   - [key2, key3]. [host3]
 * }
 *
 * Note that host2 appears twice and it appears on different key depending on which try you're on.
